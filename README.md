# STAT463 Final Project
### Group 2: Brendan Shanks, Kyana Le, Hannah Kost, and Daniel Hirstein

This GitHub project contains code written in Python that performs statistical methods on a dataset also provided in this project. Methods include aggregating the data for easier use, finding the skewness and kurtosis of the data, and performing the bootstrap method to find the distributions of our skewness and kurtosis estimators.

Also attached are the graphs that the code produces: a graph of the data itself, a skewness bootstrap graph, and a kurtosis bootstrap graph. These are contained in the Graphs folder.
